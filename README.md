### 🚀 About Me
I’m an **AI Engineer** at the **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan**, where I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **agentic AI**, and **geospatial analytics** to power real-time decision support systems for disaster risk reduction and resilience planning.

My work focuses on transforming Earth observation, climate, and sensor data into **AI-powered early warning systems**, using models that learn, reason, and act autonomously.

### 💡 What I Build
- 🤖 **Agentic AI Systems** – LLM-based agents for real-time analysis, decision support, and automation.  
- 🛰️ **Earth Observation & Remote Sensing AI** – Deep learning pipelines using **Sentinel**, **CHIRPS**, **CMIP6**, and **Google Earth Engine**.  
- 🌦️ **AI-Powered Early Warning Dashboards** – Real-time monitoring systems for floods, heatwaves, and droughts.  
- 🧬 **Generative AI & GANs** – Exploring diffusion models and generative adversarial networks for data synthesis and enhancement.  
- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Context-aware knowledge systems that fuse AI with structured data.  
- 🧩 **ML & DL Model Engineering** – End-to-end workflows from data preprocessing to model deployment (PyTorch / TensorFlow).
